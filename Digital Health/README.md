Hello, 

This is my submission for assignment 1. 

I represented blood type as an enum of blood types. There are functions that return the blood 
types that patient can receive and give.

I represented Medicatins as a struct that holds all the information required. There is also a function that
checks if the medications is still in use by the patient based on the date it was perscribed 
and how long it was perscribed for

I represented Patient also as a atruct that contains all the required informantion and methods.

All three types have the CustomStringConvertible protocol and they all have thorough test coverage.
